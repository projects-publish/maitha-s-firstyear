I still remember how heavy my backpack felt, even though it barely had anything inside it that day. I stood outside the AURAK gate pretending to text someone just so I would look busy. It’s funny now, but in that moment it felt like everyone around me already knew where to go and what to do. High school was small—comfortable. I knew the teachers, the hallways, even the weird noise the AC made in the cafeteria. Here, everything felt huge and loud, and I felt like a tiny, lost dot in the middle of it all."

I sat down, took out my notebook, and listened to ten full minutes of an Engineering lecture on electrical systems before it hit me: this was definitely not English Literature. The professor was writing equations that looked like alien handwriting. I didn’t want to stand up and make a scene, so I did what anyone would do—I nodded along like I understood voltage currents. When class ended, I packed my stuff slowly, waited for everyone to leave, and then slipped out pretending that was my plan all along."

I was so proud of myself for not procrastinating. I clicked something — ‘Save Draft’ — then closed my laptop thinking I was done. The next morning my heart actually stopped when I saw that it wasn’t submitted. If it wasn’t for UNIV 100 teaching me how to navigate assignments and discussion boards, I would have failed that class in week one. The amount of buttons, announcements, folders and hidden links on Blackboard still confuses me, but at least I double-check everything now."

I walked in with my first essay thinking I did a decent job, only to get it back covered in red markings like someone had committed a crime on paper. But the tutor wasn’t harsh at all — she was patient. She explained every correction, introduced me to transitions I never heard of, and showed me how to make my ideas breathe better on the page. Every session felt like someone untangling a knot in my head."

At home, weekends usually mean gatherings, teas, cousins, loud conversations, and someone insisting I eat more even after I’m full. So telling my mom I couldn’t come to dinner because I had a presentation felt like I was choosing school over family. There was this guilt that followed me around all week. Eventually I bought a cheap planner from a stationery shop and started scheduling everything: classes, assignments, family dinners, even breaks. It isn’t perfect — I still mess up — but I’ve slept better since I stopped trying to do everything at once."

I’m slowly learning that smiling at strangers on campus, joining group chats, or saying yes to study sessions can open unexpected doors. Looking back at that girl standing frozen at the gate on day one, I feel a little proud. I’m not fully confident yet, but I’m getting there, one conversation, one mistake, one late-night assignment at a time."
